# PSO2 TH Archive
Welcome to the PSO2 TH (Thai) Archive Repository.

This repository contains the extracted text files from the (now offline) Thai version of PSO2.

### Why do I see JP lines in these text files?
Apparently, the TH data files saved the original Japanese translation inside of them, along with the Thai translation. The purpose is not clearly defined, although we can assume it was to make translation/checking easier.

### Please note that this is an ARCHIVE. You cannot edit files in here and any PRs proposed to this branch will be closed.
